# pyculator
my first public application developed in python, it's a simple calculator but I gave my self to it :)


so I developed it using VS Code, and I tried to explore my knowloedge and learn new things, using more "complex" stuff like loops, time, editing of lines and more. I know it has some flaws, but I tried to let it the more organized I could, and yet, I still got lots of things to learn, but well, that's what makes coding great! the searching of complex things simplified.

anyways, hope this can help someone out there, and I hope that it is my first of MANY repositories!! tysm for reading and well, enjoy lol :3
